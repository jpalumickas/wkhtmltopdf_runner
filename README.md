# Wkhtmltopdf Runner

This gem is a wrapper for a popular `wkhtmltopdf` library to generate PDF files from HTML.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile and then run `bundle install`:

```ruby
gem 'wkhtmltopdf_runner'
```

You also need to have installed `wkhtmltopdf`. Easy way to do that is to add binary files to your Gemfile.
```ruby
gem 'wkhtmltopdf-binary' # or 'wkhtmltopdf-binary-edge'
```

If you have custom path for `wkhtmltopdf` please see [Configuration](#configuration)

## Usage

### Write to File

Use in a block which has File argument that will be returned after PDF generation as a TempFile.  

#### ActiveStorage in Rails
These examples show how to attach a file to a user with [ActiveStorage::Attach](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveStorage/Attached/One.html).  
You can render PDF from HTML string:

```rb
string = '<h1>Hello user</h1>'

WkhtmltopdfRunner.pdf_from_string(string) do |file|
  user.document.attach(io: file, file_name: 'document.pdf')
end
```

You can render PDF from HTML file:

```rb
  File.open('index.html') do |html_file|
    WkhtmltopdfRunner.pdf_from_file(html_file) do |file|
      user.document.attach(io: file, file_name: 'document.pdf')
    end
  end
```

You can render PDF from URL:

```rb
  WkhtmltopdfRunner.pdf_from_url('https://github.com') do |file|
    user.document.attach(io: file, file_name: 'document.pdf')
  end
```
### Sinatra

You can send the resultant file as a download.

```rb
  WkhtmltopdfRunner.pdf_from_url('https://github.com') do |file|
    send_file file, { filename: 'document.pdf' }
  end
```

### Save to file
You can also just save it to a file.
```rb
WkhtmltopdfRunner.pdf_from_url('https://github.com') do |file|
  doc = File.open('document.pdf', 'w')
  doc.write(file.read)
  doc.close
end
```
### Render to String

If you will not provide block, PDF string will be returned.

> **Warning:** Be careful when using this method because all PDF content will
> be stored in Memory. Better to use block which will return file. See examples
> above.

```rb
pdf_string = WkhtmltopdfRunner.pdf_from_url('https://github.com')
```

## Configuration

If you're using Rails, create file in `config/initializers/wkhtmltopdf_runner.rb`

```rb
WkhtmltopdfRunner.configure do |config|
  config.debug = true # Default: false
  config.logger = Logger.new('runner.log') # Default: STDOUT or Rails.logger in Rails
  config.binary_path = '/path/to/wkhtmltopdf' # Default: will search automatically in PATH or Gemfile
end
```
